= Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/[Advent of Code].
There is a directory by year. Then, for each year there is a directory by language.

== AoC 2017 edition
I chose to use https://elixir-lang.org[Elixir] to solve the puzzles in order to learn it.
Thus, my solutions might not be optimal or might not use the common Elixir idioms.
Please feel free to submit a pull request in order to improve the code.

I think that some solutions didn't cover all special case.
While they were valid for me, some might not be working with different inputs that I got.

Unfortunately the code is not well documented since solving a puzzle is a one off task.

== AoC 2016 edition
I didn't participate in the 2016 edition. However you will find some code for this edition
in this repository. It is mostly starter code to have a workflow to solve AoC challenges
in different languages.
