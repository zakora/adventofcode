= Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains my solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/2017/[Advent of Code 2017].

I chose to use https://elixir-lang.org[Elixir] to solve the puzzles in order to learn it.
Thus, my solutions might not be optimal or might not use the common Elixir idioms.
Please feel free to submit a pull request in order to improve the code.

I think that some solutions didn't cover all special case.
While they were valid for me, some might not be working with different inputs that I got.

Unfortunately the code is not well documented since solving a puzzle is a one off task.
